# Eneroth Legacy Save

This extension quickly saves the model in a legacy SketchUp version. In contrast
to utilizing the native Save As... command you don't need to accept the file
location and confirm overwrite on each save.

If you have colleges stuck in older versions or want your files to be accessible
using SketchUp Make, which stopped being developed after version 2017, you may
find this extension useful.

Activated from **File > Save in Legacy Format**.
